# Generative Adversarial User Model for RL Based Recommendation System
Implementation of the paper ["Generative Adversarial User Model  for RL Based recommendation System"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10613) in Pytorch as part of a group project in Koc University COMP547 _Unsupervised Deep Learning Course_.

## __TODOs__:
* Create Pytorch <u>_Dataloaders_ for the datasets</u>
* Implement <u>_GAN model_ using pytorch</u>
* Create <u>_Training & Validation & Evaluation Loops_</u>
* First <u>_Training_</u> of the model
* <u>_Replicate Baseline_</u> Results in the paper
* Perform <u>_Hyperparameter search_</u>
* __(Optional)__ RL agent implementation (if time permits)
